A mod for the game Caves of Qud.

It provides a command in the Abilities menu to forbid any future follower clones from using the selected ability. Persists through restarts, but not across games.

### Options

* Apply to all new followers, not just clones. Disabled by default. Requires restart.
* Require Telepathy. Pairs well with above. Disabled by default. Requires restart.
* Use energy. Treats this as a standard instruction to a companion, i.e. time progresses. Discount from Telepathy applies. Can be very expensive, if creating a lot of clones at once. Disabled by default. Requires restart.
* Clear the list. Applies immediately.

### Attribution
Code for inserting a command into the Abilities menu was inspired by/partially based on the excellent mod [Tidy Ability Bar! by Tyrir](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3394062891)
